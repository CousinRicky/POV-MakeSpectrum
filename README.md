# MakeSpectrum

![Thumbnail](makespectrum_thumbnail.jpg)

This library generates reflective spectral power distribution curves for spectrum-based rendering in POV-Ray without recourse to a spectrophotometer. The user submits a color specification, and a spline is returned. Some of the curves are designed to resemble reflection spectra of typical non-metallic surfaces.

The user can then convert the splines to POV-Ray’s native RGBFT format using other tools, such as [Lightsys IV](http://www.ignorancia.org/index.php/technical/lightsys/) or [SpectralRender](https://www.lilysoft.org/CGI/SR/Spectral%20Render.htm).

This project is a proposed module for the Persistence of Vision Raytracer (POV-Ray) Object Collection.
